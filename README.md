      in every field of life trust plays a important role ,a truth is a firm in the reability,ability                                      or strength of someone or something..
     A trust is a legal arrangement where certain persons (called trustees) hold property for the benefit of others (called      beneficiaries).   A trust is usually established by way of a trust deed - a document setting out the rules for the           trust, signed by the persons putting assets into the trust (called the settlors) and the trustees. The most common      type of trust in New Zealand is a discretionary family trust, which usually has family members as beneficiaries.

     Trust is a major aspect in the relationship between humans and autonomous safety-critical                                     systems, such as autonomous vehicles. Although human errors may cause higher risks, failures of                              autonomous systems are more strongly perceived by the general population, which creates difficulities in the                 adoption of autonomous safety-critical systems. 
     In the incressing of the population , technology and the general awerness of resourses accumption  and the need to     create a suitable and successful future require solutions is enable to aapted a ecolohgical technologies.. There is two     main characteristics that help to build a trust in human, namely emotion, and morality. the fact that autonomous     vehicles would compute the best tactical decision way in advance, which could lead to complete accident avoidance, the     affect characteristic of the trusting process leads to another difficulty.the number of persons will lost there life in    road accident ,many families lost there beloved family members . In Europe alone, 25,600 lives were lost on the roads    in 2016  which is a failure rate of 0.5x10-6 per hour. Assuming a 1000-fold improvement of self-driving vehicles,    which would decrease the failure rate but would still be two to three deaths per year.this is a sign that cant    improvement compared to the failures rate caused by human errors while driving, the engineers tryiny to  to create a    relationship of trust with human users. One major distinction between the users interaction with an automated as    opposed to that with an autonomous systems is the fact that while there are approaches for humans to monitor the    automated processes of a system, 

   People have used machines for centuries to improve their mobility, first on the ground, later at sea, and then in the    air. While the next generation of cars will have a set of software functions that can be activated on demand, future    systems will be able to receive new capabilities in the field   We assume that future automotive systems will be    subject to continuous development and delivery of functions that adapt driving behavior and integrate cars into mobility    ecosystems. This vision relies on the runtime delivery of software smart agents that must interact with the underlying    platform in a trustworthy manner. The progress towards fully autonomous driving will be gradual. In the process of    achieving full driving autonomy, human responsibilities will gradually be replaced by autonomous driving functions. For    example, the function of adhering to speed limits around school areas, which is currently the drivers responsibility, will    very likely be controlled by software smart agents in the future. These might be downloaded when entering a city as a    precondition for obtaining driving permissions in that city. Acceptance for this kind of autonomy must be built up    gradually to ensure acceptance by both drivers and pedestrians. We therefore envision the incremental development of    autonomy on the road as a win-win situation for instrumenting the building of trust on both sides. In order to build a    trusting relationship, the driver and the system need to evolve together in a process that creates sustainable trust and    supports the interchange of the human trustee with a software smart agent.

INTRODUCTION: there is many languages which was spoken and understand by human but when human human waant to communicate with copmputer what is te way?the only way is MACHINE LANGUAGE because computer can only understand machine language and machine language is a set of 0s and 1s it is also called binary language.initially computer only understand machine or binary language but in 2nd generation of computer high level languages was developed to communicate with computer and with the improvement in computer many comuter languages was develop to make way easy to communicate with computer . There is many students who interst in learning computer programming languages like c++,java,assembly language ,python,database etc.in programming language we write a programe to give our message to computer .A program is a set of instructions or statements for directing the computer to perform a required data-processing task.
Software is often written using multiple programming languages ,which expects the developers to master multiple programming languages.Recentresearch has shown that knowledge of one language can interfere with learning a new language  Developers and computing students are usually expected to master multiple programming languages. To learn a new language, developers often turn to online search to find information and code examples learning a new language,developers use anopportunistic learning strategy,relating concepts in a new language to their previous languages  .As the terminology between languages often differs drastically,this makes code searche specially difficult. Yet,developers frequently turning to code search to find code examples to learn from and improve their productivity during development activities 
Suppose a Computer Science student gets an internship at a bank. Their team manager is happy that they have several years of programming experience, and expects them to program with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) and create macros in spreadsheets.However,the student has never been taught VBA at school,and now they have to learn this new language on their own.
The intern gets their first task, and decides to search online for how to perform it in VBA, but the keywords are specific to the language they know,such as “dictionary” from Java paired with their new context,VBA.This leads to results that are either in VBA but with information not relevant to the task at hand,or results in Java that are relevant,but in the wrong language..Approximately 50% of queries that precede clicks on documentation or tutorials successfully solved the problem.Students frequently borrowed terms from languages with which they are familiar when searching for examples in an unfamiliar language,but term borrowing did not impede search success.Edit distances between reformulated queries and non-reformulated queries were nearly the same.These result shave implications for code search research,especially on reformulation, and for research on supporting programmers when learning a new language.



RESULT:   Programming languages is the only way to communicate with computer there are way many computer languages which was used to communicate with computer like c++,jave assembly language,cobal etc.every language has their own syntax ,code and terminologies which makes language differ from other language.
many students can have command on only one language which they seen easy but suppose  when computer science or developer students get a job in  a bank the team manger  happy that they have several years of programming experience, and expects them to program with unfaamiliar language ,however the student has never been taught this language at school,and now they have to learn this new language on their own.
this make difficulties to understand a new language the students use many resourses to understand this language student search this language basic tutorials  and code examples. Search success in this study was associated with consulting official documentation and tutorials rather than on Q&A sites (e.g., Stack Overflow). Additionally, mapping the context in an unfamiliar languages to previous knowledge in a familiar language,and borrowing the corresponding terms,also led to search success. Lastly,natural language phrases were more associated with success than coding shortcuts.
so we have command in any one language but we have to learn or have interst in other  languages too.
